Sancerre Lucien Crochet Country: France
Region: Sancerre
Grape: Sauvignon Blanc
ABV: 12.5%
Vintage: 2008
Bottle Size: 75cl
A huge Customer Favourite.
It's no wonder this is so difficult to get your hands on these days. One taste of the tropical fruit flavours and big, bold citrus zest that are the hallmarks of this top French Sauvignon make it abundantly clear that this is staking its claim as one of, if not the top Sancerre. A classic wine that deserves some pretty classic seafood.

Riesling QbA, Weingut Tesch Grape Variety: Riesling
Country of Origin: Germany
ABV%: 11.5%
Bottle Size: 75cl
An all round customer favourite.
When will we start drinking Riesling again? It is arguably the best white grape of them all but many people are still reluctant to buy anything without Chardonnay on the label. Never oaked, this is for those who like their wines crisp, fruity, with a 'whoosh' of acidity.

This is a great wine to kick off a party or to be enjoyed by the glass in front of a good film.
Creamy with more than a hint of strawberries, this wine is just a little off-dry.
Perfect as an aperitif, its just the ticket for getting any evening going.

A most impressive English sparkler!
The fact is that really good spakling wine is better than middle of the road Champagne. And less than half the price. What makes it so yummy? Firstly, it's a lovely wine even without the bubbles - fruity and crisp with a tangerine freshness and not to dry. Secondly, it only has half the bubbles of Champagne - so it is much gentler to drink. You'll love this wine even if you don't like Champagne!
